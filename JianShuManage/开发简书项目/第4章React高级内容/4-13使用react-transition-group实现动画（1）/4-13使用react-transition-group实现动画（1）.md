    CDN / External
    Since react-transition-group is fairly small, the overhead of including the library in your application is negligible. However, in situations where it may be useful to benefit from an external CDN when bundling, link to the following CDN: https://unpkg.com/react-transition-group/dist/react-transition-group.min.js
